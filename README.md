_**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**_
  
  Proper testing is the best way to ensure functionality and security. It is important that you understand how your code runs when fed certain use case scenarios and if there are any vunlerabilities due to dependencies and libraries used within the appliction. Static and Dynamic testing offer coverage for different instances when creating an application. I think applying both these testing formats helps narrow down issues within your code, creating a clean and secure program.

_**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**_
  
  User needs are the framework for creating a program. That is why I spend ample time understanding user needs. Wheter this be from e-mail chains or direct meetings, it is imperative that a discussion is had both before and during the developement of the applicaiton. Keeping an open line of communication with your client will help you better frame your coding towards they're needs, and incorporating them is simply a matter of finding the best solution that you can to achieve they're goal(s).

_**How do I approach designing software?**_
  
  As stated above I think designing software comes from first understanding what it is your client hopes then end progarm to accomplish. This can help you with your decisions for aspects like, security, funcitonality, and general ease of use. I think using a client's needs and goals will help shape the design of your project naturally throughout it's development.
